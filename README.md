# SQL-Projects
Projects and mini projects: problems solved by using SQL.
To each "project" I created a folder, which contains a document with statements, a database and the scripts.
If you want to test my codes, please, upload the database with your SQL Program (I used MySQL Workbench) and copy my scripts.
This repository is a way to show interested parties my portfolio;
